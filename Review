#Code Review

1. First one should be the error handling  - Whenever using async await need to use try/catch block to catch the error and not to break the application
2. Need to move out the api function definitions outside the useEffect for performance upgrade.
3. Generalize the method fetchProducts, fetchVariants, fetchReviews.
4. Instead of using document.getElementById we can use the react hook useRef for better compatibility.
5. Need to check whether the api responses are fullfilled before using it like this product?.imageUrl
